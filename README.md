Movie Review Sentiment Analysis using DistilBERT

This project performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews using a pretrained DistilBERT model fine-tuned to classify reviews into Positive or Negative sentiments.

The workflow includes loading and preprocessing the IMDB dataset, text tokenization, model fine-tuning, accuracy evaluation, and testing the trained model on new custom text inputs.
